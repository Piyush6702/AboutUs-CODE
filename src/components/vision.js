          With the rising trend of video consumption, we believe videos are a great medium to educate & train people. But we found a gap that there are not much product video creation tools or video-first product onboarding platforms. So we went and built one. With Trainn you can create product training videos including product walkthroughs and host as a training academy
           or embed within your product as structured learning paths during onboarding process.
